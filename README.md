# feat-engineering-slides
Slides for study group on [Feature Engineering and Selection...](http://www.feat.engineering/) by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson. Slides were created in late 2019 by Bryan Shalloway and Stephen Kimel as supporting materials for an internal study group we led on the book. Slides are in both .ppt and .pdf formats (.ppt slides frequently have slide animations that were used to set the pace for group discussion).

Slides are composed almost entirely of key quotes and figures that we copied from the associated chapter of Max and Kjell's book (if there is not a reference on a figure, you can assume it came from the associated chapter of [Feature Engineering and Selection...](http://www.feat.engineering/)). We sometimes copied figures from other sources (references for these are typically made explicit on the slide) and occassionally created new figures ourselves.

Materials are not cleaned-up or 'ready-made' for cource materials (should view primarily as a collection of notes and key exerpts for discussion). For more polished materials, we recommend exploring https://www.tidymodels.org/ 

# Changes from original content

1. Removed any links to internal materials or company branding and applied "Office" powerpoint theme across slides
    1. Due to resizing issues this caused I went through and fixed any *glaring* issues (did not worry about things being perfect)
1. Ensured images copied from other sources had a link or reference
1. Saved file with a consistent title, i.e. feat-ch<#>-<notes>.ppt e.g. feat-ch2-part1.ppt
1. Saved a .pdf version of the slides

# Who made which slides?

For the most part Bryan made slides for odd chapters, Stephen made slides for even chapters. (Though there are exceptions to this, e.g. Stephen created slides for some parts of chapter 3).
